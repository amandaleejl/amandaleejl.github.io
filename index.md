- [Airbnb Price Prediction - Capstone Project](https://github.com/amandaleejl/projects/tree/master/airbnb_price_capstone)
  + Predict potential airbnb listing prices in Singapore with high accuracy.
  + Used XGBoost to predict the housing price with a good MSE and R2 score.
  + Picked out factors that contribute significantly to the listing prices that will be useful for further marketing strategies.
- [Reddit Horror Stories Classification](https://github.com/amandaleejl/projects/tree/master/nlp_web_apis_classification)
  + Scraped two subreddits NoSleep (fictional horror stories) and TheTruthIsHere (true personal encounters with the unknown) through a webscrapper. 
  + Through this the scraped data from the two subreddits were passed through separate classification models, CountVectorizer/TfidVectorizer with Bayes Classifier and LogisticRegression that will assign each observation to the most likely class of subreddit. 
  + The model successfully helped to classify posts into their separate categories with high accuracy.
- [Predicting West Nile Virus](https://github.com/amandaleejl/projects/tree/master/west_nile_virus)
  + Predicting when and where different species of mosquitoes will test positive for West Nile Virus in mosquito traps to inform pesticide use.

  + The model indicated good prediction based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve of 0.826.
- [SAT and ACT participation analysis](https://github.com/amandaleejl/projects/tree/master/act_sat_standardized_testing)
